## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-tracker.git
cd mood-tracker-app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or

## How It Works

### Data Structure

The application stores mood data in the following format:

```javascript
[
  { date: "2023-07-01", emoji: "üòÄ" },
  { date: "2023-07-02", emoji: "üòê" },
  { date: "2023-07-03", emoji: "üò¢" }
]
```

### LocalStorage

The application uses browser's LocalStorage to persist mood data between sessions:

- On initial load, the app checks for existing mood data
- Each time a mood is logged or updated, the complete dataset is saved to LocalStorage
- This ensures your mood history is always available, even after closing the browser

### Views

1. **Day View**: Shows only the current day's mood
2. **Week View**: Displays moods from the past 7 days
3. **Month View**: Shows moods from the past 30 days
4. **Calendar View**: Visualizes moods in a monthly calendar format, allowing navigation between months

## Future Enhancements

- Add notes to mood entries
- Export mood data as CSV/JSON
- Statistical analysis of mood patterns
- Customizable mood options
- Dark mode support
- Authentication for multi-device sync
